Hi and welcome to RMVGDB 2.0! 

It is database powered by RAWG.io.

It has a connected Search function that allows users to search through 500,000 games within the database. The Homepage Displays the latest, most popular, and new and upcoming games. The website was created with React.js, Redux for state management, axios, styled SASS components, and animations from framer motion..

This is the first post onto github, going to maybe add some more styling, maybe give the GameDetails a different look as well.
